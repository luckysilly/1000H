给上述关于饮食的文字起一个简短的标题

Brief Version:

I've been really focusing on getting my health in check, especially with my diet.

 I'm going gluten-free, steering clear of carbs, and even watching out for additives in stuff like soy sauce.

 I'm on a keto kick, eating grass-fed steak, salmon, and mackerel, along with veggies like kale, broccoli, and choy sum.

 I mix it up with salads, juices, and steamed veggies.

 After a month, my skin's less dry, and I'm feeling lighter and more energetic.



Elaborate Version:

Lately, I've been all about getting my health on track, especially when it comes to what I'm eating.

 I've cut out gluten, keeping my distance from carbs, and I'm even picky about things like soy sauce, making sure it's got no additives or gluten.

 I'm diving into the keto lifestyle, munching on grass-fed steaks, salmon, and mackerel, and pairing them with veggies like kale, broccoli, and choy sum.

 I switch it up by having salads, juicing, or steaming the veggies.

 After sticking to this for over a month, my skin's not as dry, and I'm feeling lighter and more at ease.
